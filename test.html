        And Accreditation Council)</span></h3>
    <p>India has one of the largest and diverse education systems in the world. Privatization, widespread expansion,
      increased autonomy and introduction of Programmes in new and emerging areas have improved access to higher
      education. At the same time, it has also led to widespread concern on the quality and relevance of the
      higher education. To address these concerns, the National Policy on Education (NPE, 1986) and the Programme
      of Action (PoA, 1992) spelt out strategic plans for the policies, advocated the establishment of an
      independent National accreditation agency. Consequently, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council
      (NAAC) was established in 1994 as an autonomous institution of the University Grants Commission (UGC) with
      its Head Quarter in Bengaluru. The mandate of NAAC as reflected in its vision statement is in making quality
      assurance an integral part of the functioning of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs).

      The NAAC functions through its General Council (GC) and Executive Committee (EC) comprising educational
      administrators, policy makers and senior academicians from a cross-section of Indian higher education
      system. The Chairperson of the UGC is the President of the GC of the NAAC, the Chairperson of the EC is an
      eminent academician nominated by the President of GC (NAAC). The Director is the academic and administrative
      head of NAAC and is the member-secretary of both the GC and the EC. In addition to the statutory bodies that
      steer its policies and core staff to support its activities NAAC is advised by the advisory and consultative
      committees constituted from time to time.</p>

    <h3>Mobilisation of Funds</h3>
    <p>The main financial resource for the Institute is by way of tuition fee. The tuition fee is fixed based on the
      previous year’s expenditure and the impact of the inflation in the next three years. The institution
      furnishes all the relevant details of the expenditure and projections for every three years to the Internal
      Fee Regulatory Committee which fixes the tuition fee of the Institute as per the guidelines stated by the
      university. While submitting the projections, the Institute also incorporates increase in salaries by way of
      DA, increments, etc. The internal Fee Regulatory Committee also provides scope for the Institute to allocate
      funds for the capital expenditure, which the Institute is planning over the next three years. Hence, the
      major resource mobilization depends on the fee fixation done by the internal Fee Regulatory Committee.</p>
    <p>The Sponsoring trust, SMT. MAHALAKSHMI AMMAL EDUCATIONAL TRUST, extends financial support to the Institute
      for the shortfall and ensures the availability of requisite funds.</p>
